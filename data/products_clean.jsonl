Klean Kanteen bottles do not have a chemical lining like some other metal bottles, and they won't ever leach a chemical taste into your drinks. The large-mouth design makes it easy to pour in ice cubes or a smoothie packed with frozen strawberries. It's also easy to clean--just scrub it out with white vinegar and baking soda (or mild soap and water), or load it in the dishwasher. It's topped by a polypropylene looped cap that makes it easy to grab on the go. All Klean Kanteens are backed by a 1-year manufacturer's warranty. Klean Kanteen bottles come in several sizes: Capacity: 18 ounces (532 ml) Weight: 6 ounces Size: 7 x 2.75 inches (HxW, without cap) Opening diameter: 1.75 inches Grown-ups love the 18 ounce bottle for its compact, easy-to-carry, lightweight size that slips into bags, cup-holders, and even the water bottle cage on your bike.", "category_path": "['Sports & Outdoors', 'Accessories', 'Sports Water Bottles']", "image_url": "https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317dKBZkuVL._SY300_.jpg", "text_for_embedding": "Klean Kanteen Classic Stainless Steel Water Bottle 18 oz with Loop Cap (Reef Blue).

A mixture of boxing punches and martial arts kicks, Tae-Bo is funandeasy. One of the best elements of this four-tape set is that the first tape (which is 40 minutes long),Tae-Bo: Instructional, lays out the movements you need to successfully complete a workout. Once you've mastered the steps, you won't have to fast-forward through half the tape to get to the workout, nor will your workout be slowed down by the repeated lessons. After you feel comfortable with the movements (and they're really quite easy to follow; nothing too complicated to trip you up), you're ready to move on toTae-Bo: Basics, a 27-minute workout (5 minutes of warm-up, 18 minutes of Tae-Bo, and 4 minutes of cool-down) that will have your heart pounding and your body sweating. Next comesAdvanced, a 57-minute workout that will have your heart racing, pulse pounding, and sweat glands working overtime. There's razzmatazz on the moves, with slightly more complicated combinations that should be fairly easy to master if you've completed the first two tapes. This video seriously raises the bar on the difficulty factor.In addition to the short warm-up, the cool-down, and the 30 minutes of Tae-Bo,Advanced Tae-Boalso includes 18 minutes of muscle-crunching floor work. You know you're in trouble when even the guys in the tape have trouble keeping up. Make sure you have truly mastered the first two tapes before attempting this one.

While the 8-minute idea is compelling, it's not an adequate substitute for the longer workouts. Blanks, a seven-time World Martial Arts champion, is a superb instructor, providing encouragement and careful instruction (if you don't know by the end of the tape to hold in your stomach, that's no one's fault but your own).

Billed as the \"future of fitness\" and hawked by numerous celebrities, Billy Blanks's Tae-Bo actually deserves much of the hype it's receiving. A mixture of boxing punches and martial arts kicks, Tae-Bo is funandeasy. One of the best elements of this four-tape set is that the first tape (which is 40 minutes long),Tae-Bo: Instructional, lays out the movements you need to successfully complete a workout. Once you've mastered the steps, you won't have to fast-forward through half the tape to get to the workout, nor will your workout be slowed down by the repeated lessons. After you feel comfortable with the movements (and they're really quite easy to follow; nothing too complicated to trip you up), you're ready to move on toTae-Bo: Basics, a 27-minute workout (5 minutes of warm-up, 18 minutes of Tae-Bo, and 4 minutes of cool-down) that will have your heart pounding and your body sweating.

For those of us who are just regular old soul fans without a particular yen for club culture, it's better to think of it as a fine collection of '60s soul from Atlantic Records, most of it not very easy to get on reissues. A few hits dot the 25-track program, like the Mar-Keys' \"Last Night,\" Doris Troy's \"Just One Look,\" and the Coasters' \"Poison Ivy.\" There are also relatively underexposed items by a good number of Atlantic and Stax stars like Booker T. & the MG's, Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas, Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke, and Ben E.

Don Sickler often plays foil on trumpet, as doesRay Drummondon bass. PianistJohn Hicksmost closely approximates Spaulding's range, playing sweetly on \"Warm Valley\" and dancing through the quick take on \"Just One of Those Things.\" Rudy Van Gelder's production gives the entire session a Blue Note vibe, and Spaulding thrives in the warm sonics. He's a fast, flurrying, multitalented veteran, and it's great to hear him sound so vital.--Andrew Bartlett.

{"id": "417", "title": "Bushnell Yardage Pro 500 Laser Rangefinder", "description": "The Bushnell Yardage Pro 500 rangefinder quickly and accurately measures distances within 1 yard to help you hunt or to improve your golf game. Its compact and light design makes it a good accessory for many outdoor activities.All Bushnell Yardage Pro laser rangefinders models feature a scan mode for continuous target tracking and display distances using a multifunctional in-view LCD. All models are water and shock resistant and come with a one-year limited warranty.How a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / &#x96; 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets &#x96; like a rock cliff or semi-truck &#x96; can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets &#x96; like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Here's how it works:A.

The Bushnell Yardage Pro 500 rangefinder quickly and accurately measures distances within 1 yard to help you hunt or to improve your golf game. Its compact and light design makes it a good accessory for many outdoor activities.All Bushnell Yardage Pro laser rangefinders models feature a scan mode for continuous target tracking and display distances using a multifunctional in-view LCD. All models are water and shock resistant and come with a one-year limited warranty.How a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / &#x96; 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets &#x96; like a rock cliff or semi-truck &#x96; can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets &#x96; like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).

The backboard is constructed of high-density polyethylene, making it durable and rugged to withstand the elements. The rim features a 5/8-inch solid steel ring and is supported by 1/2-inch braces; the all-weather nylon net is long-lasting. The telescoping pole adjusts the rim height from 7.5 to 10 feet in 6-inch increments without the use of tools. To stabilize the base, a 27-gallon capacity (about 234 pounds of water or 364 pounds of sand) allow for a stable foundation.Portable basketball systems depend on a base filled with sand or water for stability. Although it will take up more space than an in-ground system, the portable base rolls on wheels, allowing players to position the basketball system in the desired location (and also allowing storage in a garage). Simply assemble, fill the base, and star shooting some hoops. There is no fussing with concrete.Amazon.com Basketball System Buying GuideWith the high-quality construction of many portable basketball systems, turning your driveway into a basketball court can be as simple as hooking up your garden hose. But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide.In-Ground SystemsIn-ground systemsare permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease.Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system.Wall-Mount SystemsWall-mount systemscan be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list.Portable SystemsPortable systemsrequire minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage.Backboard ConsiderationsRegardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101.

While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action.The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular.

{"id": "507", "title": "PNI X441 Corsa Handheld Compass", "description": "The compact Precision Navigation Corsa X441 digital compass fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is a great tool for hikes or orienteering adventures. It's also a great addition to your GPS unit, since it will provide directional information when you're in places that make GPS signals go fuzzy, like by trees or tall buildings, or if you're in a canyon.The Corsa X441 features three modes--basic compass, clock, and timer. Switching between modes and making settings changes are performed via the Corsa X441's two buttons--the device's only controls. It will return to clock mode when the compass mode times out, which is set at a default 5 minutes. You can change the settings to up to 90 minutes, or turn off this feature so that it never times out.Before using the Corsa X441 for the first time, you'll need to calibrate it. Calibration allows the device to separate the earth's magnetic field from the magnetic fields generated by external influences, such as gear you may be carrying, and thereby provide accurate heading information. Calibrating is a rather simple procedure, requiring you to slowly turn yourself around twice as you hold the compass.You can choose from two compass rose arrow orientations: directional arrow and north-pointing arrow. The directional arrow points to the direction you are heading, while the north-pointing arrow will always point to the north as on a mechanical compass. (With both orientations, North is always at the top of the display.) A magnetic distortion flag will alert you should any external magnetic interference compromise the compass heading accuracy.The timer has very basic functionality, featuring pause and restart from the pause point, reset to zero, and a maximum measurement of 99 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds.The Corsa X441 is a rugged device; it's able to sustain drops to the ground and is resistant to water up to 10 feet deep. It also features ruler markings on its back (both inches and centimeters) for measuring map distances, and an average 500-hour battery life using one lithium battery. To change the battery, you'll need to remove the back with a small Phillips screwdriver.It comes with a one-year limited warranty and includes the lithium battery installed in the device.", "category_path": "['Sports & Outdoors']", "image_url": "https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MQST97WZL._SX300_.jpg", "text_for_embedding": "PNI X441 Corsa Handheld Compass.

Its 10- to 700-yard range with 1-yard accuracy (plus or minus, without reflectors or special devices) makes it perfect for golfing, bow hunting, and archery. The pocket-sized Pro Scout is water resistant and comes with a standard 3-volt battery.How a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / &#x96; 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets &#x96; like a rock cliff or semi-truck &#x96; can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets &#x96; like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).

Our 5 x 20 golf scope is a compact 5x power monocular with internal reticle which makes estimating the range to the pin quick and easy. Comes complete with five tees, a ball marker and divot tool.Six Ways to Improve Your Game:Know the exact distance from your ball to the pinKnow the distance a wedge, sand and lob wedge will flyKnow the precise distance to execute the shot and clear the hazardManage the course wellTake a disciplined approach to the gameSelect the right club to do the jobFeatures:Extra-Long20-999 YardCarrying Case Clips onto Golf BagWater-ResistantHow a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / &ndash; 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets &ndash; like a rock cliff or semi-truck &ndash; can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets &ndash; like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Here's how it works:A. Targeting ModesScanThe Scan mode allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan with the viewfinder.RainThis feature compensates for precipitation to guarantee an accurate distance measurement through rain or snow.ZipZip allows you to accurately measure longer ranges (beyond 150 yards) when looking through foreground clutter like brush or branches.ReflectorThis feature increases the maximum measurement range for most highly reflective objects.B. Meters/YardsYou can quickly choose between these standard measuring units with a simple press of a button.C. ReticleThe distance to objects targeted in these crosshairs will be displayed on the Distance Readout with the press of a button.D. Battery IndictorFlashes when battery power is low.E. Target Quality GaugeGauge indicating amount of energy pulses being received back from the target..

The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills. A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, \"Speed on in your Speedos.\" In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn&#x92;t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself. World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it&#x92;s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets. After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale. Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa.

The Stinger has three separate diving modes with its own profile memory: regular air dive, enriched-air nitrox dive, and freediving/depth gauge with timer mode. In addition to having information available to you at all times, the Suunto Stinger records and stores data for later analysis. You can view, compare, and analyze your diving performance through a specially designed PC interface.The Stinger comes in three different versions: this one with a metallic band, one with anelastic strap, and one with atitanium housing.Suunto Stinger implements a Suunto-specific ceiling and floor feature. The decompression floor is the deepest point at which the ascent time will not increase. The decompression ceiling is the shallowest depth to which you should ascend. These depths provide the range where the diver utilizes the decompression stop most efficiently. Suunto Stinger uses the Suunto Reduced Gradient Bubble Model (RGBM) for decompression calculations.You can adjust the Suunto Stinger for diving at altitudes up to 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), and a personal level of conservatism can be added if desired. It enables you to set dive time and maximum depth alarms before your dive. The clear electro-luminescent backlight is activated automatically when dive alarms are given, making the dive parameters clearly visible and legible. The system is highly energy-efficient with only minimal power consumption. The built-in dive planning function helps you plan your next dive by showing you the no-decompression time data for different depths.In the Nitrox mode, you can program Suunto Stinger for nitrox mixtures of 21 to 50-percent oxygen in 1-percent increments. You can also adjust it for oxygen partial pressure from 1.2 bar to 1.6 bar in 0.1-unit increments. Suunto Stinger gives both visual and audible alarms when the limit for oxygen partial pressure, CNS or OTU values are exceeded.For freediving enthusiasts, Suunto Stinger introduces a 1-second precision timer with selectable 2, 4, 10, 20, 30 or 60-second profile memory-sampling rates. After 5 minutes of continuous diving in the Free mode, it automatically switches to Gauge mode. In both the Free and Gauge mode you can use a run-time timer. This makes Suunto Stinger also ideal for technical and military diving.The triple o-ring pushbuttons and its monocase design without a separate rear cover make Suunto Stinger virtually leakproof. The case has a pressure rating of 20 ATM (660 feet), so you can rely on the Stinger to work at the deepest depths.The Suunto Dive Manager (SDM) software that enables deeper understanding and better graphical representation of the data recorded and stored with Suunto Stinger.

As your strength and conditioning improve, you increase the resistance. It's that simple, and it leads to a firmer stomach, tighter hips, thighs, and buttocks, and a more muscular frame. All told, the Total Gym 1500 offers more than 60 proven exercises, and includes a multifunction attachment that delivers even more options.The unit, which is constructed of solid steel, sets up in seconds and then folds away for easy storage. And to help you get started, the Total Gym 1500 includes a two-in-one exercise video and an exercise booklet that features both beginning and advanced programs. Other details include a box-stitch seat for comfort, a handy leg-pull accessory, chrome side rails and handles, and clear cables.

Coleman's PerfectFlow appliances regulate the pressure of the propane to provide a consistent cooking performance without flaring or flickering. This steady fuel stream holds true even in cold weather, high altitudes, or when the fuel is low.This Coleman propane stove sports 2 independently adjustable 10,000 BTU burners.The stove is equipped with two 10,000 BTU burners, with independently adjustable flames that let you boil water on high (in a mere 4-1/2 minutes) while you simmer chili on low. The fuel is long lasting as well: with just a single propane fuel cylinder (sold separately), you can use both burners on high for up to an hour--more than enough time to prepare a weekend's worth of meals. Plus, the stove includes Coleman's Windblock side panels, which not only shields the burners for maximum heat, but also adjusts outward to accommodate larger pot sizes. Propane stoves are perfect for almost any social outdoor activity, including camping, hunting, tailgating, and backyard cookouts. The PerfectFlow stove measures 23.25 by 5.5 by 14.75 inches (W x H x D) when closed and carries a three-year warranty.About ColemanMore than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more.

Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name,Everlast. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the world&#x92;s heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950&#x92;s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family&#x92;s remaining 50% interest. Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000.Everlast men&#x92;s and women&#x92;s apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states. Everlast has a traditional past and a knockout future.What's in the Box?One pair of youth boxing gloves, one pair of target punch mitts.

It features a frosted, one-piece PVC vinyl frame for a low-drag profile in the water. The flared lens gaskets with hypo-allergenic seals offer good coverage around the eyes and a watertight fit. The non-scratch lenses are hard-coated with anti-fogging protection and provide 95 percent UV protection. It also features a non-adjustable nose bridge and a silicone split headstrap for optimal fit.About SpeedoIn 1914, Speedo was founded in Australia by Alexander MacRae, a 22-year-old Scottish immigrant who arrived in the country in 1910. The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills. A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, \"Speed on in your Speedos.\" In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn&#x92;t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself. World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it&#x92;s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets. After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale. Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa. The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today.

It features an altimeter, barometer, digital compass, and clinometer (for measuring slope angle). It's also the perfect tool for any cross sport--such as mountaineering, hiking or cross-country skiing--as it records and stores performance data that can be downloaded to your Windows PC.The accurate altimeter enables you to measure your vertical performance when jogging, hiking, biking or climbing. Well suited for fast sports, the Suunto X6's advanced timing functions enable you to record virtually an unlimited number of lap and split times of your activity. The chronometer records accurate altitude profiles with 10- or 60-second intervals for up to 200 hours. The adjustable alarm works as an interval reminder, for instance, to remind you of regular hydration during your adventure or extended workout session.The Suunto X6 comes packed with solutions enabling safe and responsible hiking. You can use the alarm functions to alert you at certain altitudes, help maintain safe climbing speed on the mountains, or indicate an upcoming storm. You will be much better off using the compass and altimeter if caught in bad weather. The compass also guides you back when running in an unknown place or just strolling around in a foreign city.The Suunto X6 is water resistant, tested to 100 meters/330 feet according to ISO 2281 standard, which means you can use it for swimming or other water sports activities--but it should not be used for scuba diving or freediving.The Logbook feature allows you to save information regarding, for example, a hiking trip. When you start the logbook, it starts gathering information about the cumulative ascents and descents, average ascent and descent rates, highest and lowest points and specific marks you can set during the trip. When you stop the logbook, the information gathered thus far is recorded as a logbook file that can be viewed later. The maximum duration of one logbook is 168 hours (one week). The Suunto X6 can store 20 logbook files at one time.

{"id": "862", "title": "Strat-o-Matic Deluxe Baseball Revised Edition", "description": "Strat-O-Matic is the boss of sports board games, a memory-making experience. Ideal for playing solo or in friendship-bonding face-to-face play, Strat-O-Matic is easy to learn. Yet it is challenging enough to entertain for hours, as you make the player selections and the offensive and defensive decisions that decide the outcome. Make your lineup and in-game strategy decisions. Roll the dice that activate play (think of it as the pitch or swing). Then find the result on the statistically designed player card. Every player is unique, giving every dice roll drama. The first die tells you whether to consult the batter or pitcher card and which of his three columns to check. Two other six-sided dice are added to locate the result in the correct column. What a player does most (hit for average, hit for power, strike out, etc.) shows up on the most common dice combinations. Because of Strat-O-Matic&#x2019;s unmatched play value, a full nine innings can be played in less than 30 minutes. One dice roll ends most at-bats with the outcome right off the player card. Sometimes you&#x2019;ll need a dramatic second role &#x2013; to find out if your fielder is good enough to save a run or turn a double-play, or to find out if that long fly ball is outta here or caught at the warning track. Three games in one, Strat-O-Matic will have you playing the Basic game within minutes of opening the box. Once you have a little experience, you may wish to adventure into the richly detailed Advanced and Super Advanced games, where lefty-righty advantages, ballpark effects, clutch hitting &#x2013; and much more &#x2013; practically put you in the dugout as a Major League manager.

Yet it is challenging enough to entertain for hours, as you make the player selections and the offensive and defensive decisions that decide the outcome. Make your lineup and in-game strategy decisions. Roll the dice that activate play (think of it as the pitch or swing). Then find the result on the statistically designed player card. Every player is unique, giving every dice roll drama. The first die tells you whether to consult the batter or pitcher card and which of his three columns to check. Two other six-sided dice are added to locate the result in the correct column. What a player does most (hit for average, hit for power, strike out, etc.) shows up on the most common dice combinations. Because of Strat-O-Matic&#x2019;s unmatched play value, a full nine innings can be played in less than 30 minutes. One dice roll ends most at-bats with the outcome right off the player card. Sometimes you&#x2019;ll need a dramatic second role &#x2013; to find out if your fielder is good enough to save a run or turn a double-play, or to find out if that long fly ball is outta here or caught at the warning track. Three games in one, Strat-O-Matic will have you playing the Basic game within minutes of opening the box. Once you have a little experience, you may wish to adventure into the richly detailed Advanced and Super Advanced games, where lefty-righty advantages, ballpark effects, clutch hitting &#x2013; and much more &#x2013; practically put you in the dugout as a Major League manager. This revised edition of Strat-o-Matic Deluxe Baseball features six random mystery teams from the past, plus a coupon for 6 free teams from the most current season..

Standard features include fully multi-coated optics, an image correcting 45 degree prism, an 8x20 correct image finder scope, and high and low power eyepieces for 50X and 20X magnification.The 102mm Wide View scope is a uniquely flexible modular design. Most spotting scopes in this price range are limited to views only one or two degrees wide. Celestron&#x92;s standard equipment 25mm low power eyepiece shows images 2.5 degrees wide. And when I use my own30mm Ultrascopiceyepiece I&#x92;m treated to crystal clear images across a field of view more than 3 degrees wide.A wide sharp field of view makes it easier to follow moving targets. When I spotted a 'kettle' of migrating hawks it didn&#x92;t take long to set the Wide View 102 on a tripod and follow the action. I was rewarded with a view that included a few eagles, and I was even able to snap some nice pictures.The 102mm Wide View Spotting Scope uses a 2 inch diameter rack and pinion focuser with an adapter for standard 1.25 inch eyepieces and a 'T' thread for camera use. That means the eyepieces can be upgraded at any time, with literally hundreds of options available. An easy upgrade for the Wide View 102 is Celestron&#x92;s8 to 24mm Zoom Eyepiece. Telescope magnification is calculated by dividing the telescope focal length (500 mm) by the eyepiece focal length, so the 8-24mm zoom would magnify the image from 20.8X to 62.5X, an ideal range for wildlife spotting.The other option you&#x92;ll need is a tripod. Celestron&#x92;sPhoto and Video Tripodmay be sturdy enough for visual use with the Wide View 102 spotting scope, but I like theParagon HDheavy duty tripod from Orion because it&#x92;s solid enough to serve as a base for photography as well.When I look at the night sky with the Wide View 102, the telescope offers delightful lower power views of the Milky Way Galaxy and open star clusters like the Pleiades. When I look at the Moon and planets at 100X, however, I can&#x92;t help noticing the false color or blue fringing typical of a short focal length achromatic refractor. If your first love is astronomy, check out Celestron&#x92;s Omni XLT 102 telescope. TheOmni XLT 102delivers clearer high power views of the Moon and planets because the longer focal length allows better color correction with an achromatic lens. --Jeff PhillipsPros:Delightfully sharp wide field imagesCompact and affordableAccepts 1.25-inch and 2-inch eyepiecesCons:Not waterproofBlue fringing noticeable at high power", "category_path": "['Sports & Outdoors', 'Hunting & Fishing', 'Hunting', 'Hunting Optics', 'Spotting Scopes']", "image_url": "https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31SX2VKV34L._SX300_.jpg", "text_for_embedding": "Celestron 52270 102mm Wide View Spotting Scope.

I was rewarded with a view that included a few eagles, and I was even able to snap some nice pictures.The 102mm Wide View Spotting Scope uses a 2 inch diameter rack and pinion focuser with an adapter for standard 1.25 inch eyepieces and a 'T' thread for camera use. That means the eyepieces can be upgraded at any time, with literally hundreds of options available. An easy upgrade for the Wide View 102 is Celestron&#x92;s8 to 24mm Zoom Eyepiece. Telescope magnification is calculated by dividing the telescope focal length (500 mm) by the eyepiece focal length, so the 8-24mm zoom would magnify the image from 20.8X to 62.5X, an ideal range for wildlife spotting.The other option you&#x92;ll need is a tripod. Celestron&#x92;sPhoto and Video Tripodmay be sturdy enough for visual use with the Wide View 102 spotting scope, but I like theParagon HDheavy duty tripod from Orion because it&#x92;s solid enough to serve as a base for photography as well.When I look at the night sky with the Wide View 102, the telescope offers delightful lower power views of the Milky Way Galaxy and open star clusters like the Pleiades. When I look at the Moon and planets at 100X, however, I can&#x92;t help noticing the false color or blue fringing typical of a short focal length achromatic refractor. If your first love is astronomy, check out Celestron&#x92;s Omni XLT 102 telescope. TheOmni XLT 102delivers clearer high power views of the Moon and planets because the longer focal length allows better color correction with an achromatic lens. --Jeff PhillipsPros:Delightfully sharp wide field imagesCompact and affordableAccepts 1.25-inch and 2-inch eyepiecesCons:Not waterproofBlue fringing noticeable at high power.

Once you start opening the knife, SOG's Patented SOG Assisted Technology, or S.A.T., takes over. Through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs in the knife, the force to propel the knife open becomes greater than the closing force, and the blade will open on its own. This unique feature means that if you are using your dominant hand on another task, you can just as easily open the FSA-98 with your other hand.For security and peace of mind, S.A.T. was developed in conjunction with a superior locking system. The unique design of S.A.T. knives allows them to use locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access ambidextrously than conventional liner locks.For Flash Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be released quickly with a sliding button. An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed. For easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to open.Cryogenic Heat Treatment for Sharp, Dependable BladesOf course the workhorse of any knife is the cutting surface, and FSA-98 offers a full, 3.5-inch, half-serrated blade with an elegant satin finish.SOG's proprietary Cryogenic Heat Treatment process ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly bringing the blade's temperature down to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then bringing it slowly back to room temperature. The stress created through this process relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength and edge retention.Elegant, Ergonomic Design for Ease of UseEven if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make the cuts you want if a knife doesn't sit comfortably in your hand. That's why the handle on this knife features a unique, ergonomic contour. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle helps ensure that your knife is both durable and well-balanced. And it is lightly textured to prevent slippage.At just 3.1 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in workmanship and materials.About SOG: Strong, Innovative, Specialty ToolsSOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War.

Using advanced digital technology, Yardage Pro takes the guesswork out of measuring distances. Delivers superb range performance to targets from 5 to 1500 yards away at the touch of a button. The Bushnell Yardage Pro is accurate to within one yard even if you're measuring in rain, snow or through foreground clutter like brush and branches. Measuring a mere 1.5x4x2.75 in. and weighing only 6.8 oz., the Yardage Pro Scout is the world's smallest, most advanced laser rangefinder available.FeaturesCenter Wheel Focus SystemPorro Prism SystemMulti-coated LensBaK-4 Prism Glass340 ft @ 1000 yds Field of View4.5 mm Exit Pupil16 mm Eye ReliefWaterproofTripod AdaptableHow a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / &#x96; 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets &#x96; like a rock cliff or semi-truck &#x96; can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets &#x96; like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Here's how it works:A. Targeting ModesScanThe Scan mode allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan with the viewfinder.RainThis feature compensates for precipitation to guarantee an accurate distance measurement through rain or snow.ZipZip allows you to accurately measure longer ranges (beyond 150 yards) when looking through foreground clutter like brush or branches.ReflectorThis feature increases the maximum measurement range for most highly reflective objects.B.

Take your best shot with confidence with help from a Bushnell&#xAE; Yardage Pro&#xAE; laser rangefinder. Using advanced digital technology, Yardage Pro takes the guesswork out of measuring distances. Delivers superb range performance to targets from 5 to 1500 yards away at the touch of a button. The Bushnell Yardage Pro is accurate to within one yard even if you're measuring in rain, snow or through foreground clutter like brush and branches. Measuring a mere 1.5x4x2.75 in. and weighing only 6.8 oz., the Yardage Pro Scout is the world's smallest, most advanced laser rangefinder available.FeaturesCenter Wheel Focus SystemPorro Prism SystemMulti-coated LensBaK-4 Prism Glass340 ft @ 1000 yds Field of View4.5 mm Exit Pupil16 mm Eye ReliefWaterproofTripod AdaptableHow a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / &#x96; 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets &#x96; like a rock cliff or semi-truck &#x96; can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets &#x96; like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Here's how it works:A. Targeting ModesScanThe Scan mode allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan with the viewfinder.RainThis feature compensates for precipitation to guarantee an accurate distance measurement through rain or snow.ZipZip allows you to accurately measure longer ranges (beyond 150 yards) when looking through foreground clutter like brush or branches.ReflectorThis feature increases the maximum measurement range for most highly reflective objects.B.

This griddle is essential for big breakfasts, tortillas, quesadillas, roasted vegetables and grilled sandwiches. Cast iron loves a campfire, a stovetop, or an oven, and can slow-cook foods without scorching. It retains heat well so you can sear meat at higher temperatures and will keep your delicious meals warm for a long time. Whether used in a kitchen or camp, theses virtually indestructible cookware should last for generations. Made of cast iron, this griddle evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls. Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron cookware looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron. This pre-seasoned griddle is ready-to-use right out of the box. While the cookware comes pre-seasoned to prevent food from sticking, it works best when sprayed or lightly coated with vegetable oil before use. The Lodge seasoning procedure is a multiple-step process in which the seasoning oil is applied via an electrostatic spray system that coats the cookware, then it&#x2019;s baked in commercial ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the iron. This seasoning process achieves a seasoned finish that would take many months of home use to achieve. Sometimes during this process, the seasoning oil can collect and create a bubble or slight drip at the bottom of the pan as it&#x2019;s hanging through the production process. And that in turn can turn brown as it&#x2019;s processed through the seasoning ovens. &#xA0;This brown spot is not rust but in fact, carbonized seasoning and will darken with use. &#xA0;The factory seasoning process makes Lodge cast iron products ready to use right out of the box, and the product over time &#x201C;Just keeps getting better&#x201D;. After cooking, clean with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to utensil while it is still warm. Cast Iron, like your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made.

It also aims to relieve other ailments through the ancient art of reflexology, which focuses on different pressure points in the feet to ease discomfort in other areas of the body. The Regenesis has a comfortable plastic footbed with raised pads that deliver the massage at one of two different intensity levels--both of which are fairly vigorous. Rounded acupressure pads in the center of each footbed let you target specific areas of the foot that correspond to other bodily discomforts, such as sinus inflammation, sciatic nerve pain, or thyroid irregularities. The acupressure surface warms up to over 110 degrees F so you can add heat to the massage to soothe sore muscles and increase circulation in the feet. A cold chip in the center cools feet down to either 43 degrees or 52 degrees F for reducing swelling and is more convenient than a messy ice pack. Rubber suction-cup feet keep the unit from slipping during the vibrating massage and a convenient built-in handle makes the massager easy to move from room to room. The Regenesis&#x92;s legs extend so the massage platform can be raised up for shorter legs or hang on the back of an office chair to double as a back massager.

The Elite 3200 riflescopes also feature ultrastrong, one-piece hammer-forged aluminum and titanium alloy tubes which are 30% stronger than standard aluminum scopes. They are also recoil-tested to 1000 rounds of a .375 H&H; Magnum. With 1/4 M.O.A. fingertip, audible/resettable windage and elevation adjustments, the 3200 offers everything the most avid and discriminating hunter requires.The Elite Bullet-Proof Warranty assures you that Bushnell will repair or replace, at no cost, any Elite riflescope that becomes defective during normal use.Specifications for this Bushnell riflescope include:Power: 4-12xObjective lens: 40mmField of view at 1,000 yards: 26.9 feet at 4x, 9 feet at 12xReticle: Multi-XTech TalkMagnification (Power): Riflescopes are often referred to by two numbers separated by an \"x\". For example: 4x40. The first number is the power or magnification of the scope. With a \"4x\", the object being viewed appears to be four times closer than when seen with the unaided eye.Objective Lens Size: The second number in the formula (4x40) is the diameter of the objective or front lens. The larger the objective lens, the more light that enters the scope, and the brighter the image.Field of View (F.O.V.): The side-to-side measurement of the circular viewing field or subject area. It is defined by the width in feet or meters of the area visible at 1000 yards or meters. A wide angle binocular features a wide field of view and is better for following action. Generally, the higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view.Reticle: A reticle is the crosshair or pattern placed in the eyepiece of the scope which establishes the gun's position on the target.Rainguard: Now the hunter won't miss the shot of his life by accidentally breathing on his eyepiece while aiming. Rainguard is Bushnell's exclusive, patent pending, hydrophobic (water-repellent) coating that causes condensation from rain, fog or snow to form in much smaller droplets than on standard coatings. Smaller droplets scatter less light resulting in increased light trans-mission and a much clearer sight picture. Also, water sheets off of Rainguard much more readily than off a standard coating..

And Tasco Target and Varmint riflescopes are designed to offer dedicated target and varmint shooters precise performance advantages. First and foremost, the entire line shares high-quality, multi-coated optics for crystal-clear, high-resolution images. Large objective lenses deliver impressive brightness, while the 1/4 or 1/8 minute click windage and elevation adjustments make fine-tuning accuracy not only possible but simple. The rugged waterproof, fogproof and shockproof construction ensures that all Tasco Target and Varmint scopes are engineered to meet the exacting demands of the most accurate shooters.Built to reach out and touch a prairie dog at the most extreme distance, this riflescope features a 30/30 reticle.6-24 variable magnification40mm objective lensBlack finishFully multi-coated (all air-to glass surfaces have multiple films).Tech TalkWhat the Numbers Mean:The numbers for each scope tell you the scope&#xD5;s power or magnification rating, whether the magnification can be increased or decreased with a zoom dial, and the diameter of the objective lens. So, a 3-9x40mm is a scope with a variable zoom magnification from 3x to 9x with a 40 millimeter objective lens.How Much Magnification:Because high-powered riflescopes have a smaller field-of-view than a lower powered scope, choose your magnification with the distance you will be shooting in mind. Use low power for close shots in brush or deep woods and high power when hunting distant game in the mountains, open fields and prairie.Fixed vs. Zoom Magnification:Variable power scopes, or zooms, offer the benefits of high, medium and low powers, all in one scope. Zooms are particularly advantageous in changing light, weather, environmental conditions or geographic locations and when you're hunting different types of game. In short, variables enable the hunter to use the scope under various circumstances--from close-in brush hunting to open range hunting. Fixed or low power scopes are recommended for hunting dangerous game, especially at close range or in dense foliage where a wide field of view is required and where a mistake in distance estimation could have dire consequences.", "category_path": "['Sports & Outdoors', 'Hunting & Fishing', 'Hunting', 'Hunting Optics', 'Gun Scopes', 'Rifle Scopes']", "image_url": "https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/01Q83T7WDRL.jpg", "text_for_embedding": "Tasco Target &amp; Varmint 6-24x40 Riflescope.

Large objective lenses deliver impressive brightness, while the 1/4 or 1/8 minute click windage and elevation adjustments make fine-tuning accuracy not only possible but simple.

To prevent light distortion from moisture, our exclusive, patented Rainguard lens coating reduces large drops of water into near-microscopic specks. Scattering far less light, their significantly smaller size results in dramatically increased light transmission and a remarkably clearer image in wet weather (including condensation from your own breath). The Elite 3200 riflescopes also feature ultrastrong, one-piece hammer-forged aluminum and titanium alloy tubes which are 30% stronger than standard aluminum scopes. They are also recoil-tested to 1000 rounds of a .375 H&H; Magnum. With 1/4 M.O.A. fingertip, audible/resettable windage and elevation adjustments, the 3200 offers everything the most avid and discriminating hunter requires.The Elite Bullet-Proof Warranty assures you that Bushnell will repair or replace, at no cost, any Elite riflescope that becomes defective during normal use.Specifications for this Bushnell riflescope include:Power: 1.5-4.5xObjective lens: 32mmField of view at 1,000 yards: 63 feet at 1.5x, 20 feet at 4.5xReticle: FireflyTech TalkMagnification (Power): Riflescopes are often referred to by two numbers separated by an \"x\". For example: 4x40. The first number is the power or magnification of the scope. With a \"4x\", the object being viewed appears to be four times closer than when seen with the unaided eye.Objective Lens Size: The second number in the formula (4x40) is the diameter of the objective or front lens. The larger the objective lens, the more light that enters the scope, and the brighter the image.Field of View (F.O.V.): The side-to-side measurement of the circular viewing field or subject area. It is defined by the width in feet or meters of the area visible at 1000 yards or meters. A wide angle binocular features a wide field of view and is better for following action. Generally, the higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view.FireFly Glowing Reticle: When you see a trophy your eyes light up. Now you'll have the scope to match. Developed by Bushnell engineers especially for the lowest light hunting situations, our new FireFly reticle illuminates the cross hairs after only a quick 1-2 minute charge with a flashlight. Unlike battery-powered reticles - which often fail at the absolute worst times - the FireFly reticle will glow green and you will see your crosshairs against the animal.Rainguard: Now the hunter won't miss the shot of his life by accidentally breathing on his eyepiece while aiming. Rainguard is Bushnell's exclusive, patent pending, hydrophobic (water-repellent) coating that causes condensation from rain, fog or snow to form in much smaller droplets than on standard coatings. Smaller droplets scatter less light resulting in increased light trans-mission and a much clearer sight picture.

{"id": "1584", "title": "Stamina Gyrotonic Transformer 1500", "description": "The Gyrotonic Transformer 1500 is a home gym system that gives you traditional and full-range-motion Gyrotonic workouts all in one unit, to sculpt your body, and teach it to move with more grace and coordination. In addition to traditional linear weight lifting exercises, like squats, curls, and presses, the Transformer also incorporates \"Gyrokinesis\", full-range-of-motion exercises to strengthen and lengthen ligaments and attachments as well as increase flexibility in all major muscle groups.Perform over 70 traditional and Gyrotonic full-range-motion exercises that are relaxing and refreshing to muscles and ligaments. Each Gyrotonic exercise allows your muscles to extend and contract fully, with uninterrupted motion that improves the range of movement and flexibility of every joint. You are able to both stretch and strengthen your muscles with minimal effort while mobilizing your joints and articulating your spine. Add attachments for specific sports training. With the baseball, golf, tennis, and boxing attachments, the Gyrotonic Transformer 1500 uses the unique Gyrotonic technique to train specific muscle groups to improve your sports performance.Gyrokinesis was created from a combination of moves used in swimming, gymnastics, yoga, dance, tai chi, and weight lifting where muscles are extended and contracted fully with uninterrupted motion. Gyrotonic exercises allow your body to achieve full range of motion to reshape, strengthen, tone, and improve not only how you look but also how you feel and move for the strength, speed, flexibility, hand/eye coordination, and overall body control needed to excel at any sport.The Gyrotonic Transformer comes with an instructional video, exercise chart, and owners manual. The machine is easy to use for both complex and simple exercises. The rotating arm resistance is adjusted with an easy to use knob.

The gloves feature foam padding and double-stitched seams for extra durability and holes at the palm for comfortable ventilation. An elastic strip on the inner wrist assures a snug fit and makes them easy to put on and take off.About EverlastThe name Everlast is synonymous with boxing. Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910. Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name,Everlast. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the world&#x92;s heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950&#x92;s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family&#x92;s remaining 50% interest. Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000.Everlast men&#x92;s and women&#x92;s apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states.
